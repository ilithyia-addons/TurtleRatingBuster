# TurtleRatingBuster 🐢

TurtleRatingBuster calculates ratings for various specs and classes based on stat weights defined by the community.
It is heavily inspired by VanillaRatingBuster, and I would like to thank the original authors to have created it.

## How to install

In the Turtle WoW launcher addons section, click "Add new addon" and enter the following URL: https://github.com/ilithyia-addons/TurtleRatingBuster.git
